1. The request url is matched to a specific ruby block in the defined controller files which will handle that request. Headers and (GET/POST) are parsed and made available to the framework. It is possible to put filters in place, which are executed before that block of code is run. The response body is usually generated by a view (erb or haml markup) but could also be a code block generating json. On the way back out, sinatra adds the necessary headers to the response.

2. A user shouldn't be able to submit data twice so he doesn't make the same change to the system twice.

3. In the MVC model the data should be rendered in the VIEW part (in our case in the haml markup files).
